TOPIC MODELING MARTHA BALLARD'S DIARY

* 'Topic modeling' is a new term for me.

* Dead links to Matthew Jockers.

SUBLIME TEXT EDITOR

* Installed with no issues.

* Saved urls.txt in a different directory, had to move to it.

* After some googling, I found the answers to my issues (https://superuser.com/questions/511486/how-to-start-open-a-file-folder-that-contains-space-in-its-name-through-command).

ANACONDA

* Installation very slow. 20+ minutes that caused severe computer lag.

* Ran basic test commands, worked fine. (Screenshot 1).

WGET

* Set up was easy enough.

* Instructions on syllabus weren't working via Anaconda Powershell. (Same errors as Nadia in Discord).

* Worked via default Windows Command Prompt. Downloaded all of the files with no issues.

* Got to test out navigation commands further. Worked well. Got the diary images downloaded.

  * Discovered that quotations can be used to navigate to folders that have spaces in their names! (Screenshot 2).
  
* Followed the instructions and downloaded all war diary photos with no issues.

APIs

* Wrote out all the code, got the data.json file to be created with no issues.

OCR

* RStudio installation would not work via Anaconda. Had to download directly from their website.

* Followed the steps for the RStudio coding. A bit daunting to read and work through, but it all worked first time.

* Navigating and keeping track of tabs and files in RStudio was my biggest issue this week.

  * Still quite new to coding, so it felt like everything was all over the place. Without screenshots in syllabus I would have been lost.
